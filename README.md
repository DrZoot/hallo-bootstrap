hallo-bootstrap
===============

hallo.js with all of the jQuery UI theming removed and replaced with Twitter Bootstrap classes.

This is extremely rough but does what I want.

I have only tested the folowing plugins:
- halloformat
- halloheadings
- hallojustify
- hallolists

Please note that this only removes the need for the jQuery UI CSS, you will still need to include at a minimum jquery.ui.widget.min.js or the full jQuery UI file.
